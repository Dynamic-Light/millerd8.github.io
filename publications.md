    <h2> Clinical Research Evidence </h2>
Dynamic Light's SpeckleView&reg; technology has 20 years of research evidence to support its utility in the operating room. Back in 2001, co-founder Andrew Dunn demonstrated the first use of laser speckle to image blood flow in a rodent brain. Andrew Dunn translated the use of laser speckle to the operating room and published the <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.3526368.pdf"> seminal paper</a> in 2010 demonstrating the ability of SpeckleView technology to monitor cerebral blood flow during neurosurgery. This was followed with a demonstration of SpeckleView technology with an <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.JBO.18.9.090501.pdf"> endoscope</a> in 2013. A <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.NPh.1.1.015006.pdf"> 2014 paper</a> showed the utility of SpeckleView technology in 10 neurosurgery patients, followed by a <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1177/0271678X16686987.pdf"> 2017 demonstration</a> of quantitative blood flow monitoring in 8 neurosurgery cases. A recent 2021 manuscript directly compared <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.21254954v1"> SpeckleView with indocyanine green angiography</a> demonstrating that the techniques provide different, yet complementary information about vessel perfusion.

  Andrew Dunn was awarded the 2017 TAMEST Edith and Peter Oâ€™Donnell Award in Engineering for his pioneering work in developing laser speckle contrast imaging to visualize blood flow during surgery.

Background: Anesthetized animal models are used extensively during neurophysiological and behavioral studies despite systemic effects from anesthesia that undermine both accurate interpretation and translation to awake human physiology. The majority of work examining the impact of anesthesia on cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been restricted to before and after measurements with limited spatial resolution.
New Method: We used multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI), an advanced form of laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), to characterize the dynamics of isoflurane anesthesia induction on cerebral vasculature and blood flow in the mouse brain.
Results: The large anatomical changes caused by isoflurane are depicted with wide-field imagery and video highlighting the induction of general anesthesia. Within minutes of exposure, both vessel diameter and blood flow increased drastically compared to the awake state and remained elevated for the duration of imaging. An examination of the dynamics of anesthesia induction reveals that blood flow increased faster in arteries than in veins or parenchyma regions.
Comparison with Existing Methods: MESI offers robust hemodynamic measurements across large fields-of-view and high temporal resolutions sufficient for continuous visualization of cerebrovascular events featuring major changes in blood flow.
Conclusion: The large alterations caused by isoflurane anesthesia to the cortical vasculature and CBF are readily characterized using MESI. These changes are unrepresentative of normal physiology and provide further evidence that neuroscience experiments would benefit from transitioning to un-anesthetized awake animal models.
