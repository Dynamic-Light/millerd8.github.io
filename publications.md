    <h2> Clinical Research Evidence </h2>
Dynamic Light's SpeckleView&reg; technology has 20 years of research evidence to support its utility in the operating room. Back in 2001, co-founder Andrew Dunn demonstrated the first use of laser speckle to image blood flow in a rodent brain. Andrew Dunn translated the use of laser speckle to the operating room and published the <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.3526368.pdf"> seminal paper</a> in 2010 demonstrating the ability of SpeckleView technology to monitor cerebral blood flow during neurosurgery. This was followed with a demonstration of SpeckleView technology with an <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.JBO.18.9.090501.pdf"> endoscope</a> in 2013. A <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.NPh.1.1.015006.pdf"> 2014 paper</a> showed the utility of SpeckleView technology in 10 neurosurgery patients, followed by a <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1177/0271678X16686987.pdf"> 2017 demonstration</a> of quantitative blood flow monitoring in 8 neurosurgery cases. A recent 2021 manuscript directly compared <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.21254954v1"> SpeckleView with indocyanine green angiography</a> demonstrating that the techniques provide different, yet complementary information about vessel perfusion.

  Andrew Dunn was awarded the 2017 TAMEST Edith and Peter Oâ€™Donnell Award in Engineering for his pioneering work in developing laser speckle contrast imaging to visualize blood flow during surgery.
