   Dynamic Light imaging technology is revolutionizing the way blood flow is visualized during surgery. The technology provides real-time and continuous visualization of blood flow in tissue to reduce the risk of surgical complications.

  <p>
  The videos below compare Dynamic Lightâ€™s technology (left video) with the current standard of care Indocyanine green angiography (right video). The comparison videos were recorded simultaneously during a stroke and play at the same sped up time rate.

     Dynamic Light's technology, which does not require the injection of a dye, provides high-quality blood flow images continuously. In the image, red indicates high flow and blue indicates no flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The white signal in the indocyanine green angiography images indicates the dye is in the vessel and thus the surgeon assumes flow in that vessel. Notice that the indocyanine green signal quality degrades quickly since the dye is cleared from the system within about 10 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This comparison serves to demonstrate that Dynamic Light technology provides surgeons with real-time actionable information about blood flow, in this instance that a clot has formed. Our technology is complementary to ICG angiography by offering real-time and continuous blood flow monitoring.

<h2> Clinical Research Evidence </h2>

Dynamic Light's SpeckleView&trade; technology has years of clinical research evidence to support its utility in the operating room. Back in 2010, co-founder Andrew Dunn published a <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.3526368.pdf"> seminal paper</a> demonstrating the ability of Speckle imaging to monitor cerebral blood flow during neurosurgery. This was followed with a demonstration of Speckle imaging with an <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.JBO.18.9.090501.pdf"> endoscope</a> in 2013.
A <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1117/1.NPh.1.1.015006.pdf"> 2014 paper</a> showed the utility of Speckle imaging in 10 neurosurgery patients, followed by a <a href="https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/media/papers/10.1177/0271678X16686987.pdf"> 2017 paper</a> demonstrating the ability for quantitative blood flow monitoring with Speckle in 8 neurosurgery cases.
