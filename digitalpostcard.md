 		Dynamic Light develops algorithm and software technology that harnesses the dynamics of light for better healthcare.  Our patented technology enables continuous blood flow monitoring of the brain surface using the principles of dynamic light scattering to generate ‘speckle’ images, which yield non-invasive, real-time, continuous, and quantitative visualization of blood flow in living tissues.  Blood flow visualization is a critical parameter for successful surgical procedures. The current technology for this is 60 years old, cumbersome, and low resolution.  More importantly, the current technology can only monitor blood flow at a single time point, thus allowing most malfunctions of the brain system, such as stroke, to go undetected.  Dynamic Light’s technology can be easily integrated into a variety of existing surgical platforms for rapid market penetration and it has potential new markets beyond surgical imaging.
