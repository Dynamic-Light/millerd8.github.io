		<h2> Elizabeth Hoff, CEO </h2>
Elizabeth joined as CEO in September, 2021. She brings a wealth of experience to Dynamic Light having spent 20+ years in the global medical technology space. She has a track record of guiding, launching and succeeding in disruptive technologies that change the standard of care for patients and physicians. Elizabeth started as a sales representative at Guidant, and worked her way up to leading European, Middle East & Africa sales and marketing teams in revolutionary products in cardiac, vascular and general surgery. After her international years at Guidant, Elizabeth led the planning and execution of the wildly successful launches of W. L. Gore’s endovascular endograft programs (AAA and thoracic) which catapulted Gore to market leadership against large public competitors. She was hired by Medtronic as the first VP and General Manager of the newly formed Implantable Cardiac Diagnostics Business Unit within the Cardiac Rhythm Division. She pioneered the vision, had P&L responsibility, scaled a robust team and set the stage for one of the largest organic development programs and launches in Medtronic’s history -- the Reveal LinQ implantable cardiac monitor, which has fundamentally changed the care of patients with cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Most recently she’s been an executive at Fannin Innovation and DM Clinical Research where she’s assessed regulatory pathways, looked at early stage technology startups, and worked closely with large pharmaceutical companies. She has also had a passion for Executive Coaching and has been active with clients from all sectors. Elizabeth is an evangelist for technologies that will improve patient outcomes and has proven that she can work closely with surgeons, strategics and clinical societies to change the standard of care. Her leadership experience, history of achieving goals, bias toward action and deep knowledge of surgery and operating theaters is a welcome addition to the Dynamic Light Board of Directors. Elizabeth graduated with a double major in business and psychology from Rice University, and lives in Houston. She is on several leadership councils at Houston Methodist Hospital, is a Board Member Emeritus on the National Eczema Association, an active participant at St. Luke’s United Methodist Church, an elected HOA officer in her condo association, and a Wall Street Journal aficionado.

		<h2> David Miller, PhD, VP Engineering and Product Management, and Co-founder </h2>
David serves as the Vice President of Engineering and Product Management. David co-founded Dynamic Light in 2018, and has led the neurosurgical clinical trials for many years evaluating the clinical efficacy of Dynamic Light’s SpeckleView technology. David works closely with neurosurgeons in the clinic, and hardware and software integration for product market fit. David received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from UT Austin under the guidance of Andrew Dunn, and postdocotral training at UT Austin and Johns Hopkins. David has participated in the NSF I-corps entrepreneurial program during which he interviewed numerous neurosurgeons about the need for Dynamic Light’s technology during neurosurgical procedures, and was the team lead for the UT Austin Dell Medical School Texas Health Catalyst Program which provided seed funding for Dynamic Light.

			<h2> Andrew Dunn, PhD, CSO, and Co-founder </h2>
Andrew is the Director of the Center for Emerging Imaging Technologies and is a Professor in the Biomedical Engineering Department of The University of Texas at Austin.  Andrew's research is focused on developing novel optical imaging techniques for imaging brain function.  His laboratory integrates innovative photonics and computational techniques and applies them to research questions in areas such as stroke, migraine, functional mapping during neurosurgery, and Alzheimer’s disease. One of the techniques Andrew has developed is laser speckle contrast imaging of blood flow, which he has used to dynamically image the cerebral blood flow changes during stroke, migraine and normal brain activation.  Andrew works closely with neuroscientists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons in the application of these imaging techniques to various problems related to brain function. He is a founder of, and leader in, the field of laser speckle imaging and, in particular, implementation of continuous, real-time, high resolution speckle imaging enabled by sophisticated proprietary algorithms and software libraries.  Andrew and his laboratory team have authored many of the seminal papers in the field, and have conducted human clinical trials with his technologies, as well as extensive animal studies.
